A Rust-based backend service designed to handle user accounts and authentication across the entire JoltAMP app ecosystem. The system enables single account access for multiple apps by leveraging JWT-based authentication and a centralized authorization model.

- Built with Rust for safety and performance.
- Uses Rocket (web framework) for routing and API handling.
- SurrealDB as the backend database for flexible, scalable data storage.
- Implements JWT tokens for secure, stateless authentication.
- Designed to support seamless login and account management across all connected JoltAMP applications.
